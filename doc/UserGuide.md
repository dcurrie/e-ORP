## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary (`dd` in the code) is used for inputs to the model, and outputs from the
model. It is stored at the completion of each projection as a csv file. 

The `dd` is indexed by plan year, with year 0 being the "base year." Each row of the `dd` 
represents one plan year, and each column a parameter. Here is a guide to the parameters.

The *name* is the one used in the code and in the csv file column name. *I/O* defines 
whether this column is an input to the solver, an output from the solver, or both. The *S* 
column indicates whether the cell at row 0 is used for "squirreled away" parameters. See below.

All dollar amounts are in $000s.

### Squirreled Away Parameters

There are some cells in row 0 that are unused by the solver, such as all of the output-only columns, and many of the 
calculated input columns (as opposed to the user input columns). These otherwise unused cells are used to hold 
miscellaneous inputs to the model, such as rates of return and inflation rate. This makes the `dd` csv file a 
complete record of the projection.

This `squirrel_map` shows the names of these miscellaneous parameters and the column name of the squirrel away location.

| Name            | Column        | Description |

| `frac_stock`    | `from_jRoth`  | User input fraction of the account that is invested in stock-like securities |
| `ror_bonds`     | `from_eTaxd`  | User input Rate of Return on the bond-like portion of the account |
| `ror_stock`     | `from_jTaxd`  | User input Rate of Return on the stock-like portion of the account |
