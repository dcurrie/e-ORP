Optimal Retirement Planner

Inspired by the now unmaintained (and unavailable?) `i-ORP` by James S. Welch Jr., this
is a Jupyter notebook version of that optimizer. It is far less capable, and still quite new.

## DISCLAIMER

This tool is freely offered for your enjoyment, but please be aware that:

1. It is new and undoubtedly has defects
2. I am not a financial planner 
3. I am not an expert in linear programming optimization

**Use at your own risk!**  

If you find what you believe is a defect in the code, please report it!

## Features

- [x] `e-ORP` optimizes with either of two objectives: maximize annual disposable income (as `i-ORP` did) or maximize the "Plan Surplus," the Final Total Account Balance (FTAB)
- [x] `e-ORP` calculates US Federal Income Taxes each year for Married Filing Jointly, Single, or Head of Household
- [x] `e-ORP` calculates the OBBBA extra retirement tax deduction ($6000 over 65 between the years 2025 through 2028), and the phase out for MAGIs above $150,000 (joint, $75,000 single)
- [x] `e-ORP` calculates the IRMAA amount, including Medicare Part B base premium and both Part B and Part D surcharges, and subtracts it from SSA benefits when calculating disposable income
- [x] `e-ORP` calculates Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts
- [x] `e-ORP` will optionally include Roth Conversions in the plan to achieve the objective
- [x] `e-ORP` implements the Traditional Spend Model (TSM), calculating the maximum initial spending for the first year of retirement and adjusts it for all subsequent years by the spending inflation rate specified
- [x] `e-ORP` implements the Changing Consumption Spend Model, the "smile" curve, calculating the maximum initial spending for the first year of retirement and adjusts it for all subsequent years by the smile curve based on the spending inflation rate and anticipated spending level specified
- [x] `e-ORP` implements support for a taxable pension or annuity for each spouse, each with three options: fixed payments, COLA payments, lump sum distribution
- [ ] and TODO survivor benefits
- [x] `e-ORP` can be configured to use Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) to reduce taxable income from RMDs
- [ ] `e-ORP` TODO: does not handle separate planning horizons for the two spouses

## Known Limitations and Quirks

- [ ] `e-ORP` only handles decumulation, it makes no contributions to retirement accounts
- [ ] The `i-ORP` investing glide path is not implemented
- [ ] nor is the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment
- [ ] nor is the 3-PEAT simulation
- [ ] Spending models other than TSM and Changing Consumption (above) and are not implemented
- [ ] There is no support for Extraordinary Non-recurring Expenses
- [ ] There is no accounting for State income tax
- [ ] There is no support for tontines
- [ ] There is no support for non-liquid assets (home sales, reverse mortgages, etc.)
- [ ] There is no support for Affordable Care Act (ACA) income limitation
- [ ] There are undoubtedly several other missing `i-ORP` features, but none that I ever used!

### Why make `e-ORP` available with all these limitations?

`e-ORP` is useful to me, and might be of use to others. I offer it in that spirit.

Releasing `e-ORP` as open source software opens the door to enhancements by others, and to "forks." 

If `e-ORP` proves useful, maintenance can be taken on by anyone with Python skills, so it does not depend on my support to continue.

## Basic Usage Instructions

### On Binder

You can use the `e-ORP` tool interactively on Binder using [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dcurrie/e-ORP/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fe-ORP.ipynb)

Just click the â–¶ run button

### On your local device

The advantage of running `e-ORP` on a local device is that your data can be saved and loaded.

The disadvantage is that you need to have a little Python/Jupyter-lab knowledge.

You will need Python 3 installed. Testing was done on Python 3.13.5 on macOS, 
which I installed using Homebrew. You will also need `make` to build `jupyter-lab`
and all the dependencies, and launch it in a virtual environment.

You can run `e-ORP` from a clone of this repo with:

```
make run
```
